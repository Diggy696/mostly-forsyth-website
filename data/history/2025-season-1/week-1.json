      "commentary": "Evan Chase left no doubt that he is clearly #1.  Stomping out his computer opponent was a convincing way to start the season with 350 yards through the air against a Clemson team that was a top ten computer based contender.",

      "commentary": "Looking to be another top dawg this season, having been demoted to the West Coast. Brooks and his men carried out a tough fight, losing by 6 to the fourth ranked computer based Bulldogs of UGA before convincingly winning against the Badgers at home.  He's just starting to get rolling averaging 430 yards per game.",

      "commentary": "An overrated Oline.  A defense that just can't seem to get a stop.  Throwing crap against the wall and it's just not working. The Badgers look not so bowl-worthy after consecutive losses to a computer based TAMU team and a sluggish Brooks Ore coached Cardinal.",
